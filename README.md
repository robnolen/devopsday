#EMC CF/Photon.io Demo #

The focus of this project is to demonstrate the ease of Pivotal Cloud Foundry to create a small 'IoT-Lite' (&copy;@mcowger) application.

We will be using a Photon.io protyping board to sample the ambient temperature in a room, and display those readings on a Python Flask web app.  Readings will be posted to a REST API and stored in a redis key/value store on Cloud Foundry.
